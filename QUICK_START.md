# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Odoo Hackathon Expense Management System

## ✅ System Status

All components are created and functional:
- ✅ Backend API running on port 3001
- ✅ Frontend running on port 5175
- ✅ Database seeded with demo data
- ✅ All pages created (Login, Employee Dashboard, Manager Approvals, Admin Panel)
- ✅ All components built and working
- ✅ Authentication system fixed and working

## 🎯 **MAIN FIX APPLIED**

**Problem**: Not redirecting after login/signup
**Solution**: Changed API URL from port 3000 to port 3001 in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Test Right Now

### Option 1: Create a New Account

1. **Open Application**: http://localhost:5175
2. **Click**: "Don't have an account? Sign up"
3. **Fill Form**:
   ```
   First Name: Test
   Last Name: User
   Company ID: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
   Email: testuser@example.com
   Password: password123
   ```
4. **Click**: "Sign Up"
5. **Result**: Should immediately see the Employee Dashboard! 🎉

### Option 2: Use Demo Accounts

The database already has these demo users (all passwords are: `password`):

**Admin Account**:
- Email: sarah.admin@techcorp.com
- Password: password
- Access: Full system access

**Manager Account**:
- Email: mike.manager@techcorp.com  
- Password: password
- Access: Can approve/reject expenses

**Employee Account**:
- Email: alice.employee@techcorp.com
- Password: password
- Access: Can submit expenses

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### Check 1: Browser Console (F12)
After login, you should see these logs:
```
AuthContext: Starting login...
AuthContext: Login response received: {message: "Login successful", user: {...}, token: "..."}
AuthContext: Setting user state: {id: "...", email: "...", ...}
AuthContext: User state set successfully
Authentication successful
AppContent render - user: {...} isLoading: false
```

### Check 2: localStorage (F12 > Application > Local Storage)
Should contain:
- `user`: JSON object with user data
- `authToken`: JWT token string

### Check 3: UI Changes
- Login form should disappear
- Dashboard should appear
- Navigation menu should be visible
- You should see "My Expenses" or appropriate dashboard

## 🎨 What You'll See After Login

### Employee Dashboard
- **Header**: "My Expenses" with statistics
- **Add Expense Button**: Create new expenses
- **Expenses List**: Your submitted expenses with status
- **Features**:
  - Upload receipt (OCR)
  - Multi-currency support
  - Draft/Submit workflow
  - View/Edit/Delete actions

### Manager Dashboard
- **Approvals Tab**: See all pending expense approvals
- **Features**:
  - Approve/Reject expenses
  - Add comments
  - View employee details
  - See expense history

### Admin Panel
- **Full System Access**:
  - User management
  - Company settings

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Step 1: Check Backend
```bash
# In PowerShell, test backend:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return: {"status":"OK","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Step 2: Check Frontend Dev Server
- Should be running on http://localhost:5175
- Look for "ready in XXXms" in terminal

### Step 3: Clear Everything
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Step 4: Check Network Tab (F12 > Network)
1. Try to login
2. Look for request to `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/signup`
3. Click on it
4. Check:
   - **URL**: Should be `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/...`
   - **Status**: Should be `200` or `201`
   - **Response**: Should have `user` and `token` fields

### Step 5: Restart Everything
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd c:\odoo-hackathon\backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd c:\odoo-hackathon\frontend
npm run dev
```
