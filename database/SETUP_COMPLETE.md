## 📋 Next Steps for Team

### Backend Developer
1. ✅ Install database driver (`psycopg2` for Python, `pg` for Node.js)
2. ✅ Use connection string above
3. ✅ Start building REST API endpoints:
   - `POST /auth/signup`
   - `POST /auth/login`
   - `POST /expenses`
   - `GET /expenses`
   - `POST /expenses/:id/submit`
   - `GET /approvals/pending`
   - `POST /approvals/:id/approve`
   - `POST /approvals/:id/reject`

### Frontend Developer
1. ✅ Wait for backend API endpoints
2. ✅ Use demo credentials to test login
3. ✅ Build UI based on Excalidraw mockup
4. ✅ Test with real data from database

### UI/UX Designer
1. ✅ Create high-fidelity designs in Figma
2. ✅ Design components for:
   - Login/Signup
   - Dashboard
   - Expense submission form (with OCR)
   - Approvals queue
   - Admin panel
   - Analytics
