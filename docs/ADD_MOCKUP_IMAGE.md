# Add the design mockup image

To include the UI mockup in the README, place the mockup image file at:

```
docs/mockup.png
```

Recommended image properties:

- Format: PNG (or JPG)
- Size: 1920×600 (landscape wide) — scale as needed
- Optimize for web: use a compressed PNG/JPEG to keep the repo size small

After adding the file, the README will automatically render the image in the "Design mockup" section.
